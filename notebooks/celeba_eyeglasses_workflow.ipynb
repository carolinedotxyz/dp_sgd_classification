    "This notebook compares standard training with Differential Privacy SGD (DP-SGD) on the CelebA eyeglasses classification task. We use **matched hyperparameters** and the **AdamW optimizer** for both approaches to isolate the privacy-accuracy trade-off.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** Standard machine learning models can leak sensitive information about their training data, even after training is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Risks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Membership Inference Attacks**: An attacker can determine whether a specific person's data was used to train the model. For example:\n",
    "   - A healthcare model trained on patient records could reveal if your medical data was in the training set\n",
    "   - A face recognition model could reveal if your photo was used for training\n",
    "   - 📚 Learn more: [Shokri et al. (2017) - Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05820)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Inversion Attacks**: Attackers can reconstruct training examples from the model. For instance:\n",
    "   - A model trained on medical images might allow reconstruction of patient faces\n",
    "   - A language model might reproduce verbatim text from training data\n",
    "   - 📚 Learn more: [Fredrikson et al. (2015) - Model Inversion Attacks](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfredrik/papers/fjr2015ccs.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attribute Inference**: Models can reveal sensitive attributes about individuals:\n",
    "   - A model trained on public photos might leak private attributes (e.g., location, relationships)\n",
    "   - Financial models might reveal income or spending patterns\n",
    "   - 📚 Learn more: [Fredrikson et al. (2014) - Privacy in Pharmacogenetics](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfredrik/papers/fjr2014icml.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters for CelebA:**\n",
    "CelebA contains celebrity photos with attributes. Without privacy protection, a trained model could:\n",
    "- Reveal which celebrities were in the training set\n",
    "- Potentially reconstruct training images\n",
    "- Leak sensitive attributes about individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** Differential Privacy provides mathematical guarantees that individual training examples cannot be identified or reconstructed from the model, even by sophisticated attackers. 📚 Learn more: [Dwork & Roth (2014) - The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf)\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Core Idea:** Differential Privacy ensures that the output of an algorithm (like a trained model) is **nearly identical** whether or not any single individual's data was included in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"Neighbor\" Analogy:**\n",
    "Imagine two training datasets that differ by exactly one person's data (these are called \"neighboring datasets\"). A differentially private algorithm produces outputs that are so similar for both datasets that an attacker cannot tell which dataset was used—and therefore cannot identify any individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Privacy Parameter (ε, epsilon):**\n",
    "- **Lower ε = Stronger Privacy**: ε=0.1 means very strong privacy (outputs are nearly identical)\n",
    "- **Higher ε = Weaker Privacy**: ε=10 means weaker privacy (more information can leak)\n",
    "- **Common Values**: \n",
    "  - ε < 1: Very strong privacy (used for sensitive data like medical records)\n",
    "  - ε = 1-10: Moderate privacy (common for many applications)\n",
    "  - ε > 10: Weak privacy (may not provide meaningful protection)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Property:** Differential Privacy is **compositional**—if you use a private algorithm multiple times, you can track the total privacy budget consumed (ε_total = ε₁ + ε₂ + ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It's Powerful:** Unlike ad-hoc privacy techniques, differential privacy provides **mathematical guarantees** that hold even against attackers with unlimited computational power and background knowledge. 📚 Learn more: [Dwork (2006) - Differential Privacy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/differential-privacy/) | [Dwork & Roth Textbook](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf) | [NIST Privacy Engineering Guide](https://www.nist.gov/publications/differential-privacy-sharing-practices)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Differential Privacy SGD (DP-SGD)** is a privacy-preserving machine learning algorithm that provides formal privacy guarantees during training. It modifies standard SGD by:\n",
    "- **Clipping gradients** to bound their sensitivity\n",
    "- **Adding calibrated noise** to gradients before updating model parameters\n",

    "\n",
    "**How It Works (Step-by-Step):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standard SGD**: Computes gradients from a batch of training examples\n",
    "2. **Gradient Clipping**: Limits the maximum influence of any single example by clipping gradients to a fixed norm (e.g., 1.0)\n",
    "3. **Noise Addition**: Adds carefully calibrated Gaussian noise to the clipped gradients\n",
    "4. **Parameter Update**: Updates model parameters using the noisy gradients\n",
    "5. **Privacy Accounting**: Tracks how much privacy budget (ε) has been consumed\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Intuition:**\n",
    "- **Clipping** ensures no single example can have too much influence\n",
    "- **Noise** makes it impossible to determine which examples contributed to the gradient\n",
    "- **Accounting** ensures you know exactly how much privacy you've used\n",
    "\n",
    "**What It Protects Against:**\n",
    "- ✅ Membership inference attacks (can't tell if a specific example was in training)\n",
    "- ✅ Model inversion attacks (can't reconstruct training examples)\n",
    "- ✅ Attribute inference (can't infer sensitive attributes about individuals)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Trade-off:**\n",
    "Privacy comes at the cost of some accuracy. The noise in gradients makes training less efficient, and the model may converge to a slightly lower accuracy. This notebook quantifies this trade-off through matched-pair comparisons.\n",

    "- Explore different privacy parameters (`noise_multiplier`, `max_grad_norm`)\n",
