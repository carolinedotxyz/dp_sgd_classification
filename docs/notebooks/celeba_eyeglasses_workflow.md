This short guide accompanies `notebooks/celeba_eyeglasses_workflow.ipynb`.

### Prerequisites

4. Analyzes the processed dataset

### Running
Open and run all cells in `notebooks/celeba_eyeglasses_workflow.ipynb` on a fresh kernel.

### Outputs
- Subset under `data/celeba/subsets/eyeglasses_balanced_20k/`
- Processed under `data/celeba/processed/eyeglasses_balanced_20k_64/`
- Plots and CSVs saved alongside the data roots
